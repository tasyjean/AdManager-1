1
00:00:00,073 --> 00:00:03,117
Oh, they should. I own the place.

2
00:00:03,576 --> 00:00:06,537
How could you want to raise children
in a city like this?

3
00:00:06,705 --> 00:00:10,416
-Well, I was raised here. I turned out okay.
-Is Wayne Manor in the city limits?

4
00:00:10,583 --> 00:00:12,084
Is--? Heh-heh.

5
00:00:12,252 --> 00:00:13,794
The Palisades? Sure.

6
00:00:13,962 --> 00:00:18,424
You know, as our new DA, you might wanna
figure out where your jurisdiction ends.

7
00:00:18,591 --> 00:00:22,553
I'm talking about the kind of city
that idolizes a masked vigilante.

8
00:00:22,721 --> 00:00:26,098
Gotham City is proud of an ordinary citizen
standing up for what's right.

9
00:00:26,266 --> 00:00:28,517
Gotham needs heroes like you,
elected officials...

10
00:00:28,685 --> 00:00:31,979
-...not a man who thinks he's above the law.
-Who appointed the Batman?

11
00:00:32,147 --> 00:00:35,983
We did. All of us who stood by
and let scum take control of our city.

12
00:00:36,151 --> 00:00:37,901
But this is a democracy, Harvey.

13
00:00:38,069 --> 00:00:39,820
When their enemies were at the gates...

14
00:00:39,988 --> 00:00:43,699
...the Romans would suspend democracy
and appoint one man to protect the city.

15
00:00:43,867 --> 00:00:46,452
It wasn't considered an honor,
it was a public service.

16
00:00:46,619 --> 00:00:50,748
Harvey, the last man that they appointed to
protect the republic was named Caesar...

17
00:00:50,915 --> 00:00:54,334
-...and he never gave up his power.
-Okay, fine.

18
00:00:54,502 --> 00:00:55,836
You either die a hero...

19
00:00:56,004 --> 00:00:59,047
...or you live long enough
to see yourself become the villain.

20
00:00:59,215 --> 00:01:00,000
Like...
